Hello World (👋🌎) I'm a Data Analyst 👨‍💼📊 who enjoys coding 👨‍💻 & drinking ☕. My current learning focus is on generating **Quality Assurance Dashboards** to help stakeholders make **data-driven decisions**. To do so, I used **Power BI + Python**.

I'm also doing side hustles on **Machine Learning** 🤖 and **Deep Learning** 🧠.

Welcome to my **thoughts and projects** on data science I've been documenting through blogging ✍️. My **learning path** is mainly base on 📚 books and MOOC's 👨‍💻 from Coursera, Edx and related resources i've collected myself and saved into **Notion**. Let's learn together. 💪💯
